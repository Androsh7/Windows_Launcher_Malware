## How the launcher works
1. The program reads "IDR_RCDATA" which points to the binary file "RCDATA.bin" which contains the executable to be dropped
   - Note you must include the full path for resource.h at the start of the code, everything else is automatically included by the compiler
2. The program then proceeds to create a folder and file depending on whether or not it has user or admin permission

User: Creates
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<HKCU_folder_name>
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<HKCU_folder_name>\<malware>
```
Admin: Creates
```
C:\Windows\<malware>
```
3. The program then decodes the data in the resource file and writes it to the the malware file created in step 2
4. The program then establishes persistence in HKCU or HKLM depending on whether it is run as admin or user
User:
```
HKey_Current_User\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
<HKCU_subkey_name>    REG_SZ    C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\<HKCU_folder_name>\<malware>
```
Admin:
```
HKey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
<HKLM_subkey_name>    REG_SZ    C:\Windows\<malware>
```
5. The program finishes by running the dropped file
